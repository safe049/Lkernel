# How to use?
## You have two options
### 1. Straight to use:
Open the release folder that you uncompressed in terminal.

Then input ./lkernel , It will gives you two usage

input ./lkernel -list , It will gives you available kernels

Then input ./lkernel -S {kernel-name} , Example: 

#### ./lkernel -S linux-stable

It will help you to install.

### 2.Build it

Anyway,download the source codes,uncompress it.

open the folder in terminal,use

#### cmake --build build

now OK.

##### Just follow the step in option 1.

# Why did I make this?

#### For boring I guess

I search for something to look at is there any kernel changers,

I don't really get one so I decide to make one.

For the people new to Linux that don't know how to change your Linux Kernel.
